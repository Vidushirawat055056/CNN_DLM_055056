## 📌 Problem Statement
Handwritten digit recognition is essential for automating tasks in various domains, but traditional methods face difficulties due to the *inherent variability of handwriting. This project leverages a **Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* model to overcome these limitations. By using deep learning, the system accurately classifies handwritten digits, reducing errors and manual effort in real-world applications.

## 🔍 Data Analysis
### 1. Importing Libraries
- *TensorFlow v2*: Open-source machine learning framework by Google.
- *Keras*: High-level neural network API running on top of TensorFlow.
- *Pandas and Matplotlib*: For data manipulation and visualization.

### 2. Preparing the Dataset
- *Dataset:* MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition Dataset
- *Data Loading:* read_csv() loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- *Target Variable:* Labels stored in Y_srvr41560428train.
- *Input Features:* Pixel values stored in X_srvr4156train.

#### 2.1. Normalization
- Pixel values (0-255) are scaled to the range [0,1] by dividing by 255.
- This improves model convergence speed and stabilizes gradient updates.

#### 2.2. Reshaping
- The dataset is reshaped into (28,28,1) matrices to match the CNN input dimensions.

#### 2.3. Encoding
- Labels are *one-hot encoded* to match the CNN's output vector format, enabling multi-class classification.

#### 2.4. Train-Test Split
- The data is split into *training* and *validation sets*.
- Ensures the model generalizes effectively and prevents overfitting.
